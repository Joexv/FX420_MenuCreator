# FX420_MenuCreator
Making this public so I can get some code reviews done.
This project was made to make my life a little easier.
90% of my job as an in house IT person for a dispensary I am updating menus on TVs
And at first this consisted of, making excel files, manually converting them into pictures, 
putting thme on flash drives and walking them out to all of our TVs.
This got boring after a while so I setup some Pi Zeros with Screenly OSE and made MenuCreator
The only job this program has is to automate making thos images and to give me 
easy access to all the Excel files and Screenly links I need.

TBH use whatever part of the code you want, its all pretty basic stuff
